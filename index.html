<h2>Backstory</h2>
<h4>The drawing</h4>
<p>Between the ending of the 90s or begin of the 2000s, on <a href="https://danimesq.github.io/">Daniella Mesquita</a>'s early infancy, she was playing with drawing and using existing graphics as reference.</p>
<p>One of these references was her home city's TarobÃ¡ TV logo:</p>
<img width="100px" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/4/44/Tvtaroba1979.png/revision/latest?cb=20200410162158"/>
<p>Trying to redraw and also to do a relecture of it, it ended in the "square-eyes whale", a precursor to PRB.</p>
<p>Imagine this:</p>
<img width="100px" src="https://danimesq.github.io/img/nostalgy/prb.png"/>
<p>But with square eyes. Because it directly derived from the TarobÃ¡ TV's logo. <small>The above drawing was made in 2017 trying to reproduce the original PRB.</small></p>
<p>Eventually, PRB's "Minecraft eyes" were rounded, while PRB's round body was slendered, so as happened to the chubby original Pikachu!</p>

<h4>The name</h4>
<p>Around 2004-2005, that whale was already made for comics. Going to the cover of a comic she made, Daniella needed to give it a name. "Square-eyes whale" wouldn't make sense anymore! Daniella decided to pick objects to get inspired for a name, until picking an AAAA or AAA battery. The coincident irony: in games, when players aren't feeling creative to make a nickname, it will be always an "AAA" name in the scoreboard!</p>
<p>Daniella looked at this battery and its name was somewhat like "RTB", "TRB", etc. Then she decided this should be the name of the poor whale! Fortunately, a typo occurred and ended in "PRB". Daniella's dad, Wilson, helped "PRB" make sense: PRB = "Primeira Revista com Baleia" ("First Comic with a Whale"). Wilson even made PRB's first and only jingle!</p>

<h2>Nowadays</h2>
<h4>2010-2012</h4>
<p>As PRB's design got improved, so was its name: Zoca. But, first, it was renamed to "Bart" (from the Portuguese "jubarte" of the humpback whale) back in 2010. No idea in what year it was changed from PRB to Zoca, from that year to present - but certainly was shortly after "Bart". "Zoca" is an homage to Daniella's father Wilson, who used the "Zoca" nickname when he was a bench player in the Brazillian Botafogo soccer team in his youth.</p>
<p>Let's call PRB "Zoca" from now onward! But let's still nickname him "PRB" occasionally ðŸ˜œ</p>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">In 2010, Daniella wanted to give a fresh - but old - spin for PRB: telling the stories of PRB's ancestors. It began with a site made in MS Word, exported to HTML, named "Prb antiquity". Unfortunately, the only thing that lasted from that site is its screenshot (but thankfully capturing the entirety of its unfinished content). The original HDD containing that site was stolen in early 2019 by... ...a Daniella's cousin. <small>Click to zoom it.</small></figcaption>

<h4>2013</h4>
<p>There was a new fresh look at PRB/Zoca: a "phonemon" was made out of it, for the now <a href="https://tamigucho.github.io/" target="_blank">Tamigucho</a> franchise: <a href="https://tamigucho.github.io/tamipedia/dewhale/" target="_blank">Dewhale</a>!</p>

<h4>2020</h4>
<p>Thanks to finding out the Ethereum blockchain back on 2016, and the Vector Magic software by around 2017, Daniella Mesquita was able to find a viable way for finally debutting Zoca's first comics.</p>
<p>The result was some stories drawn, and this cover:</p>
<br/>
<figure class="figure">
  <a href="./img/sample_comicscover.svg" target="_blank"><img width="300px" src="./img/sample_comicscover.svg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A comics cover, showing a proud whale showing himself to a female whale."></a>
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Zoca standing on Ethereum's logo, tagging himself as "non-fungible boyfriend", a poke on NFTs. <small>Click to zoom it.</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Zoca debutt's main idea was to parody the DeFi ecosystem. The cover began it, to show Zoca standing on an Ethereum's logo shard/alien pyramid, tagging himself as "non-fungible boyfriend", a poke on NFTs. Looking attracted is Zoca's spouse, Agatha (who before the 2010s was named "Penelope").</p>
<p>No text other than "#1" and "Zoca AKA PRB" can be seen, because that cover was made plain to respect localization (which the comic viewer application should be responsible for adapting).</p>
<p>This is the original cover with all of the text, localized in English:</p>
<a href="./img/samplesquares/0.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="300px" src="./img/samplesquares/0.jpg"/></a>
<p>What is amazing about that, is that a LG K40S phone's camera photo was able to be transformed by Vector Magic into a good-looking cartoon vector!</p>
<p>A sneak-peek on some squares from Zoca's first official story (because the first ones from 2004-2012 were lost), vectorized:</p>

  <img width="300px" src="./img/samplesquares/1-3.svg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A pink whale using a nurse hat, calmly going to ask a question.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Agatha character being re-used to interpret a nurse unrelated to her. Similarly to the seen on <a href="https://chespirito.com/" target="_blank">Roberto Gomez BolaÃ±os</a>' series, where the same actors sometimes with recurring names and characteristics, played various characters.</small></figcaption>

<a href="./img/samplesquares/1.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="300px" src="./img/samplesquares/1.jpg"/></a>
<p>About Zoca's 2020s comics being highly tied to Web3, not only the comics will be NFTs, but also most of the issue #1's stories will be about the Web3 and DeFi, such as the vectorized BW story bellow:</p>
<a href="./img/samplesquares/6.svg" target="_blank"><img width="300px" src="./img/samplesquares/6.svg"/></a>
<p>The story above depicts, aside Penelope/Agatha, Malandrinho (Naughty), PRB/Zoca's longtime rival created much before the 2020s and even the 2010s (as he can be seen in the 2010's "Prb antiquity" story).</p>
